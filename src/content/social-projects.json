      "detailedDescription": "This study examines the feasibility of switching exclusively from combustible cigarettes (CC) to an FDA-authorized electronic cigarette (EC) and financial incentives contingent on CC abstinence to promote CC cessation among adults with a history of homelessness and are now in Housing First programs (N=40). Participants accessing services from Project HOME/Pathways to Housing are randomly assigned to either standard care (counseling and nicotine replacement therapy) or EC switching with small financial incentives for carbon monoxide-verified CC abstinence plus counseling. The study addresses significant tobacco-related health disparities in a population for whom standard cessation practices have not historically led to long-term cessation of combustible cigarettes.",

      "detailedDescription": "This study developed a workflow for HPV self-sampling in community settings through the SKCCC mobile screening unit. The protocol was designed to offer HPV self-sampling kits (n=30) as an acceptable and feasible approach for future larger studies. Preliminary data show 20 HPV self-sampling kits were distributed in community settings, with 5 kits returned (25% return rate) and 1 testing positive for HPV (20% positive rate). The participant with the positive finding was successfully connected to the physician for follow-up care. This research has potential to significantly improve cervical cancer screening rates among cancer survivors and underserved populations.",

      "description": "Chinese Wellness Culinary Circle: A feasibility study to improve healthy cancer survivorship through a mind-body-culinary medicine approach",
      "detailedDescription": "Cancer is the leading cause of death in the U.S. Asian community. In Philadelphia, Chinese immigrants constitute the largest Asian subgroup. While many are aware of cancer prevention as a concept, they often lack the knowledge or tools to adopt preventive behaviors in daily life. To address this gap, the Chinese Wellness Culinary Circle (CWCC), a culturally tailored culinary medicine program, was developed for the local Chinese community. The primary aim of this pilot feasibility study was to evaluate feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. Secondary aims included exploring changes in cancer-preventive dietary behaviors, self-efficacy, and perceived nutrition-related barriers. Methods: The CWCC program was delivered in person from April to July 2025 and included six 2-hour sessions. Each session began with a 30-40 minute nutrition education segment focused on cancer-preventive properties of food commonly used in Chinese cuisine, followed by a culturally relevant hands-on cooking activity and group discussion. Topics included the gut-brain-body connection, immune system health, antioxidants and cancer-fighting foods, hypertension, and the psychological effects of food. Participants received bilingual materials and culturally tailored recipes. Engagement strategies included pre-session reminders and post-session emails with slides. Feasibility and acceptability were assessed using specific progression criteria (e.g., recruitment, retention, assessment feasibility, and intervention acceptability) to determine whether the study procedures are practicable and whether to proceed to a larger trial. Acceptability was evaluated through post-session surveys capturing satisfaction and likelihood of applying learned practices. Baseline and post-program surveys were used to measure changes in knowledge, dietary behaviors, and self-efficacy.Results: At baseline 14 participants (mean age: 54 years; range 32-80) enrolled. Most identified as female (79%) and Asian (85%), with 79% having resided in the US for more than 25 years. 71% of participants reported 'somewhat' or 'very' confident in choosing and cooking affordable healthy food. All participants cooked at home in the past week, though most consumed limited fruits (N=10) and vegetables (N=9). Common barriers included concerns about produce spoilage and low satiety. Key participant interests included improving nutrition knowledge, cooking skills, and chronic disease prevention/management. Final feasibility, acceptability, and potential efficacy data will be collected and reported prior to the conference. Conclusions: Preliminary findings suggest that CWCC is a feasible and acceptable community-based program; integrating cultural values, hands-on learning, and bilingual education may improve engagement and reduce nutrition-related disparities among Chinese community. Future studies should evaluate long-term dietary changes and clinical outcomes in larger samples.",

      "description": "This project evaluates a 3-month cooking program that empowers Spanish-speaking cancer survivors through nutrition education and culinary skills training. Conducted at Mi Salud Wellness Center, the program teaches cancer-preventive cooking while building dietary confidence. By providing culturally-tailored, practical tools, it helps underserved communities reduce cancer risk and supports recovery—serving as a model for nutrition-focused community health interventions addressing health disparities.",

This program aims to increase cancer screening knowledge, improve health literacy, and promote early detection among underserved and diverse populations across the Philadelphia region.",
      "detailedDescription": "Our Cancer Screening Awareness and Education Programming represents a comprehensive community-based initiative developed and delivered by the Community Outreach and Engagement Team at Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center. This program is designed to address cancer screening disparities and barriers to preventive care access in underserved communities.\n\nProgram Goals:\nThe primary objectives are to increase awareness about cancer screening guidelines, improve health literacy regarding the importance of early detection, and empower community members to take proactive steps toward preventive care. We focus on multiple cancer types including breast, colorectal, cervical, and prostate cancers.\n\nCommunity Engagement Approach:\nWe partner with community organizations, health centers, and local leaders to deliver culturally tailored education programs. Our approach emphasizes community participation, addresses social determinants of health, and integrates patient testimonies and survivor stories to create meaningful connections with diverse audiences.\n\nEducational Content:\nProgramming covers cancer risk factors, screening recommendations, available screening resources, navigation of the healthcare system, and emotional support for individuals undergoing screening or diagnosis. Materials are available in multiple languages to ensure accessibility.\n\nTarget Populations:\nWe prioritize outreach to underserved populations including low-income communities, racial and ethnic minorities, immigrant and refugee communities, and individuals with limited access to preventive care. Special attention is given to populations with higher cancer burden and lower screening rates.\n\nCommunity Partnerships:\nOur work involves collaboration with community health centers, nonprofit organizations, faith-based organizations, and health departments to ensure programs meet local needs and leverage existing community infrastructure and trust.\n\nImpact:\nThrough systematic outreach and education, we aim to increase cancer screening rates, reduce cancer mortality, and promote health equity across the Philadelphia region. Our programs contribute to the institutional commitment to advance health equity and eliminate cancer disparities.\n\nFor more information about our community outreach initiatives, visit:\n\nhttps://www.jeffersonhealth.org/clinical-specialties/cancer/community-outreach-engagement",
